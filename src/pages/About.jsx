              <h3>From Humble Beginnings</h3>
              <p>
                The journey of Sheetal Sweets & Bakery began when Mrs. Sheetal Patel, armed with her 
                family's treasured recipes and a passion for authentic sweets, opened a small shop in 
                the heart of the city.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her dedication to quality and authentic flavors quickly earned a loyal following. As word 
                spread about the exceptional taste and quality of her sweets, the business expanded to 
                include a bakery section, offering fresh bread, pastries, and custom cakes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, the second generation of the Patel family continues the legacy, blending traditional 
                methods with modern techniques to create sweets and baked goods that honor our heritage 
                while meeting contemporary tastes and preferences.

              <h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>
              <h3>Mrs. Sheetal Patel</h3>
              <p>
                With over 40 years of experience in sweet making, Mrs. Sheetal Patel is the heart and soul 
                of our establishment. Her journey began in her mother's kitchen in Gujarat, India, where 
                she learned the art of traditional sweet making.
              </p>
              <p>
                "My philosophy has always been simple â€“ use the best ingredients, follow traditional 
                methods, and put love into everything you make. That's the secret to creating sweets 
                that not only taste good but also bring joy to people's lives."
              </p>
              <p>
                Though semi-retired now, Mrs. Patel still oversees the quality control and trains new 
                sweet makers, ensuring that every product meets her exacting standards.
